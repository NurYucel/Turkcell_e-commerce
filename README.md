# Turkcell_e-commerce
### We want to create an E-commerce system. Spring Boot 3.0.4 will use Maven as the package manager and version 17 or higher as the Java SDK.
(You just need to add Spring Web and Swagger dependencies.)

Req 1 : Products must be kept in the system.

Req 2: The product will have properties in the form of id, name, quantity, price and description.

Req 3 : Write the codes that can add, delete, update, list the products, bring them with id. Make it completely in memory.

Req 4 : The price information of the products must be greater than 0.

Req 5: The quantity of the products cannot be less than 0.

Req 6 : The description (description) field of the products should be a minimum of 10 characters and a maximum of 50 characters.

---- (Solve algorithmically by writing code without using validation package) ----

Layered architecture will be used in the project as we saw in the lesson. Upload your codes to github.
Get help from your other friends in the parts you have difficulty or cannot do.
